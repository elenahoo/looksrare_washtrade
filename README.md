# LooksRare wash trade simulation

This code shows how the LooksRare wash trade simulation is done as described in my article [here](https://elenahoo.medium.com/looksrare-washing-trading-reward-simulation-fea6272bf89a) by changing one of the three moving components:
- u: Individual trader’s volume in $ETH
- v: Total daily volume in $ETH
- e/l: $ETH/$LOOKS exchange rate, where e is Ether’s price in USD and l is LOOKS price in USD

For explanation of what wash trade is and the analytical metrics including the daily trade volume, top 10 wash traders, see my CoinTelegraph artilce [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/clever-nft-traders-exploit-crypto-s-unregulated-landscape-by-wash-trading-on-looksrare) and my Dune Analytics dashboarde [here](https://dune.xyz/elenahoo/LooksRare-Wash-Trading).
